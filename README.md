a simple modified based on the raw code of paper "MERCURY: Fast Transaction Broadcast in High Performance Blockchain Systems " to realization three attacks mentioned in paper.
There are inflation attack,deflation attack and oscillation attack.
I only modified the sim file, the other files can be found in the open source address given by the author of the paper.
The main change in the code is to the generate_virtual_coordinate function at lines 337 to 406.
Secondly, I've also commented out some of the output.
